# Monnas
We are Monnas, a team of six undergraduates from Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT), with four in Computer Science and two in Environmental Resources. The name Monnas combines Mon from “Tropical Monsoon Climate,” highlighting our environmental focus, and Nas, a friendly nod to the NASA competition.

Our strength lies in combining programming expertise, spatial analysis skills, and environmental science knowledge to create innovative WebGIS applications. We are passionate about making space data accessible, practical, and impactful for real-world sustainability challenges.
